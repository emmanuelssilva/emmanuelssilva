👋 Hi, I’m @emmanuelssilva, I am majoring in Computer Science at Universidade Nove de Julho. 👀 Currently I am looking for an internship opportunity in the technology area, 
specifically in Front-End Development and Flutter.

🌱 I’m currently learning HTML,CSS and Javascript. 💞️ I am starting my career in the development area, my passion for programming started very early, when I was younger, 
I developed some projects in Pawn(C Language) in Gta San Andreas Online, due to the problem I had with my old computer, unfortunately I lost the projects :( 

📫 How to reach me ...
